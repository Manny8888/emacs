This is a file to store some miscellaneous functions I use every now
and then. 

* Jekyll functions
I use ~jekyll-publish-draft~ to move a post from _drafts/ to _posts/
which publishes it to my blog. Inspiration from [[http://pasoev.github.io/programming/2015/10/31/jekyll-posts-emacs-capture/][here]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun today-is ()
    "Return current year-month-day."
    (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d"))

  (defun jekyll-drafts ()
    (let ((default-directory
            (concat (projectile-project-root) "_drafts")))
    (file-expand-wildcards "*.md")))

  (defun jekyll-publish-draft (post)
    "Mark one of the posts from the Jekyll drafts directory as published.
     This actually means moving the post from the _drafts to the _posts 
     directory."
    (interactive
     (list (completing-read "Post to publish: "
                            (jekyll-drafts) nil t "")))
    (copy-file (concat (projectile-project-root) "_drafts/" post)
               (concat (projectile-project-root) "_posts/" (today-is) "-" post))
    (delete-file (concat (projectile-project-root) "_drafts/" post)))
