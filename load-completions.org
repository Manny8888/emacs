* Company mode
  Company mode provides autocompletion of text and code.

* Yasnippet 
  Yasnippet allows you to type an abbreviation and then expand it into
  a template. We can look at yasnippet's documentation [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][on github]]. 

  Yasnippet by default checks for snippets in two places: a path
  relative to yasnippet.el (these are the default snippets that come
  with the package). If I want to make my own, I can put then in
  ~.emacs.d/snippets~ and it should find them there as well. 
  
  You can use the tab key to expand a snippet once you've typed in the
  "key". It's pretty smart in that if tab fails for yasnippet, it then
  checks for whatever tab was originally bound to.
